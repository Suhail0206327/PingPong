# PingPong

Welcome to the PingPong documentation. We all know that ping pong is a favorite game of all time. Here i will walk you through how i made this game.

## Steps for making the game :

  1. We need a ball, a paddle.
  2.  The ball should be moving with in the screen and should bounce back when it touches the edges.
  3.  The paddle movement should be controlled by the user. The paddle movement is linear it just move to and fro in the x axis.
  4.  When the ball hits the paddle it should increase the score and it should bounce back.
  5.  When the ball miss the paddle and hits the southern edge it should stop the ball and display the message game over.
  6.  The user should be able to start a new game after the game over.

     1. So here a canvas is used in the screen1 and a ball sprite and an image sprite are added. An image made using Microsoft Paint is used for the paddle.
